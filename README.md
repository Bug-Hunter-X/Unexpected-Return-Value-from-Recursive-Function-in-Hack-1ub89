This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating an unusual behavior in recursive functions. The program defines three functions: foo, bar, and baz.  Baz recursively calls bar, which in turn calls foo. The issue lies in the unexpected return value of baz. While intuitively the final return value should be 7, the program may yield a different result. This is likely due to a compiler optimization or runtime behavior that is not immediately apparent from reading the code.  The bug.hack file contains the buggy code, and the bugSolution.hack file provides a corrected version and explanations.
